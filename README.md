Finished project

Learned about laying out CSS grid because I was struggling trying to set up the grid using flex box.

Learned to use a for loop to add divs into my grid.

Learned how to use the slider as an input.

Struggled with getting the boxes to change from white to black. Did not understand exactly why I needed to have the draw effect within the for loop that creates the divs.
